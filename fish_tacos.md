Fish tacos tend to operate a little differently than other meat tacos. To execute them effectively, you'll want to assemble:

1. Your tortillas - corn are acceptable, flour can be acceptable if you're a bad person.
2. Your fish. Recipes can cover traditional fried or oven fried
3. Acceptable options for vegetables
4. Sauce, like chipotle sauce
5. Sriracha or other hot sauce
6. Avocado or Guacamole
Warm taco shells and assemble tacos. Double shelling is more than acceptable.
